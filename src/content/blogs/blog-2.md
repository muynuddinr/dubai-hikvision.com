title: "How to Add an IP Camera to a Hikvision DVR"  
description: |  
  ## Introduction  

  Adding an IP camera to a Hikvision DVR is a straightforward process, but it requires careful configuration to ensure seamless integration. Whether you're setting up a new surveillance system or expanding an existing one, this guide will walk you through the necessary steps.  

  ## Prerequisites  

  Before you begin, make sure you have the following:  
  1. A Hikvision DVR with available channels  
  2. A compatible IP camera (Hikvision or ONVIF-supported)  
  3. A stable network connection (LAN cable or Wi-Fi, if supported)  
  4. The IP camera's login credentials (username & password)  
  5. A PC or laptop for initial configuration  

  ## Step 1: Connect the IP Camera to the Network  
  - **Wired Connection:** Plug the IP camera into your router or network switch using an Ethernet cable.  
  - **Wireless Connection (if supported):** Configure the camera via Wi-Fi using the manufacturer's software.  
  - Ensure the camera is powered on and receiving an IP address from your router (check via the camera's software or network scan tools).  

  ## Step 2: Find the Camera's IP Address  
  - Use Hikvision's SADP tool (available on their official website) to scan for connected devices.  
  - Alternatively, check your router's DHCP client list to find the camera's assigned IP.  

  ## Step 3: Log in to the Hikvision DVR  
  - Connect a monitor to the DVR or access it via a web browser using its IP address.  
  - Log in with your admin credentials.  

  ## Step 4: Add the IP Camera to the DVR  
  ### Method 1: Plug-and-Play (Hikvision Cameras Only)  
  - If using a Hikvision camera, the DVR may automatically detect it under "Camera Management."  
  - Simply confirm the addition and enter the camera's password when prompted.  

  ### Method 2: Manual Addition (For Non-Hikvision or ONVIF Cameras)  
  - Go to **Configuration > Camera Management**.  
  - Click "Add" and enter the following details:  
    - **IP Address:** The camera's IP (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)  
    - **Protocol:** Choose ONVIF (for third-party cameras) or Hikvision (for Hikvision cameras).  
    - **Port:** Default is `80` (or `8000` for some models).  
    - **Username & Password:** Enter the camera's login credentials.  
  - Click "Save" and wait for the connection to establish.  

  ## Step 5: Verify the Camera Feed  
  Navigate to the **Live View** section to confirm the camera is streaming.  
  If the feed is missing, double-check:  
  - Network connectivity (ping the camera's IP).  
  - Correct protocol and port settings.  
  - Username/password accuracy.  

  ## Troubleshooting Common Issues  
  - **No Video Feed?** Ensure the camera is powered and the DVR channel matches the added camera.  
  - **Login Failed?** Reset the camera's password or verify credentials.  
  - **ONVIF Not Working?** Enable ONVIF in the camera's settings and assign an ONVIF user.  

  ## Conclusion  
  Adding an IP camera to a Hikvision DVR is simple with the right steps. Whether using Hikvision-branded or third-party ONVIF cameras, proper IP configuration and authentication are key. If issues persist, consult Hikvision's support or the camera's manual for model-specific guidance.
